// This is an API that is similar to Observable, but we don't want users to confuse it for that so we rename things. Someone could
// easily adapt it into the Rx interface if they wanted to. Unlike in C#, we can't just implement an "interface" and get extension
// methods for free. The methods have to actually be added to the object (there are no extension methods in JS!). We don't want to
// depend on RxJS in the core library, so instead we duplicate the minimum logic needed and then users can easily adapt these into
// proper RxJS observables if they want.
